Maybe another quiz for Art/Culture. I know we have the Culture quiz, which focuses on mannerisms, but maybe another one focusing on Art and Culture could include Angry Birds, licorice, saunas, the north pool, reindeer, Moomins, Nordic walking, etc. 
Maybe one quiz devoted to the history of Suomenlinna and Seurasaari. These both have rich history and meaning. I wonder if splitting one quiz with information on both of these sites would benefit the students to have some additional background before the on-site work.
A very simple quiz on expectations might be beneficialâ€¦.Such as, you are required to: be on time, participate in all on-site work, be consciousness/respectful of your peers, instructors, and TA, this is a class for course credit. Also how to communicate (whatsap), breakfast schedules, dressing in layers, Toolo Towers amenities, our tram stop, the importance of your tram pass, etc. Kind of like a syllabus quiz to make sure everyone understands the things that should be obvious.
 

For the history quiz, question 7, this is interesting. I always thought of him as the Tsar of Russia, but from the Finnish perspective, he would be the Grand Duke, for a moment I thought it was a typo
